# Privacy Policy for TimeLife Extension

## Last Updated: April 19, 2025

## Introduction

TimeLife is a browser extension that converts prices on websites into the equivalent working time based on your hourly rate. This Privacy Policy outlines how TimeLife handles your data and explains our commitment to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What Information We Collect

TimeLife collects and stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

- Your hourly rate (as provided by you)
- Your selected currency preferences
- Display settings (format and style preferences)
- Extension enabled/disabled state

### How We Use Your Information

The information stored is used exclusively to:

- Convert prices on websites to equivalent working time
- Maintain your preferences between browser sessions
- Apply your settings consistently across tabs and websites

### What We DON'T Collect

TimeLife **does not**:

- Collect or track your browsing history
- Monitor which websites you visit
- Track which products or prices you view
- Gather any personally identifiable information
- Transmit any data to external servers
- Use cookies or other tracking technologies
- Create user profiles or analytics

## Data Storage

All data is stored exclusively using Chrome's local storage API, meaning:

- Information remains on your device
- Data is not backed up to any cloud or external servers
- Data is not shared with the extension developer or any third parties
- Data is only accessible by the TimeLife extension itself

## Permissions

TimeLife requires the following permissions to function properly:

1. **Storage**: To save your hourly rate and preferences locally on your device
2. **Tabs**: To apply settings changes across all open tabs
3. **ActiveTab**: To access the content of your current tab when the extension is activated
4. **Scripting**: To inject the necessary code to detect and convert prices on web pages
5. **Host Permissions** (<all_urls>): To allow the extension to function on any website you visit

These permissions are used solely for the core functionality of converting prices to working time and do not enable any tracking or data collection capabilities.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device and no information is transmitted externally, the security risk is minimal. The extension's code is designed to operate entirely within your browser's sandboxed environment.

## Third-Party Access

TimeLife does not share any data with third parties, as no data is collected or transmitted beyond your local device.

## Updates to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in the extension's functionality or to clarify existing practices. The date at the top of this policy indicates when it was last revised.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any personal data, there is no data for you to access, modify, or delete beyond what you directly control in the extension's settings. You can uninstall the extension at any time to remove all locally stored preferences.

## Consent

By installing and using the TimeLife extension, you consent to the privacy practices described in this policy.
